# The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.

# Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:

for n in range(2, 10):
	for x in range(2, n):
		if n % x == 0:
			print (n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
			break
	else:
		#loop fell through without finding a factor
		print(n, "is a prime number")

print('')

for num in range(2, 10):
	if num % 2 == 0:
		print("Found an even number", num)
		continue
	print("Found a number", num)
